# Dali.Challenge
This is my WebDev Challenge for the Dali Application. Though built in a short time period with no prior knowledge in coding 
websites, I was able to create a basic website to show who I am and 
why I am interested in Dali. My website is not very complex and, as of now, not mobile friendly asI 
did not have enough time to learn the code for that. However, I hope to show that I am a fast learner
and am eager to put in a lot of time and effort to improving and growing in my skills. I am hoping to take
CS52 and CS10 next term so that I can really grow in my skills for web development and coding in general. 
Thank you for the opportunity!
