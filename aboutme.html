  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src= "images/000039.JPG" alt="profile picture">
  <p> Hello! I'm Ashley Song <br/> and I am a student at Dartmouth College <br/>
   majoring in Computer Science with a <br/>
  minor in East Asian Culture.<br/>
  <p>My home is in Boulder, Colorado. <br/>
    I'm a huge advocate for offroad hiking and picnics! <br/>
   Film photography is a new hobby of mine— <br/>
   not amazing and artsy yet but I'm learning! <br/>
    Something unique about me is that in highschool, <br/>
    I won in a wall-sitting competition with a 7 minute long<br/>
    wall sit!</p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h2>Why DALI?</h2>
  <p>I found DALI through some upperclassmen friends<br/>
      who inspired me to pursue Computer Science with their<br/>
      works.<br/>
      I found that, though I have only spent such<br/>
      a short time learning CS,<br/>
      I love being hands on and creating with a team.<br/>
      Through my experience with coding,<br/>
      I've fully begun to comprehend why<br/>
      so many people say that coding is rewarding;<br/>
      when I am finally able to get my code to work,<br/>
      the satisfaction is comparable to that of when<br/>
      I finish a long hike up a 14er.<br/>
      And when I can't get my code to work,<br/>
      I find that, unlike other school assignments,<br/>
      I can sit and look through my code for hours without<br/>
      feeling extremely bored.<br/>
      Coding is something like magic...<br/>
      And DALI is the perfect place to grow<br/>
      in my coding skills and be apart of a team<br/>
      that can cohesively create something together.<br/>
      Though I am still perfecting Python in CS1 right now<br/>
      and am still teaching myself HTML, Javascript and CSS,<br/>
      I feel that I would learn quickly and enthusiastically<br/>
      in DALI.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
  <p> Thanks for visiting! </p>
